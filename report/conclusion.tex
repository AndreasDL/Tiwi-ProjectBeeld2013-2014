\section{Conclusion}
The use of image processing is not always reliable due to changes in the surrounding e.g. roadworks, more light, less light, seasons that change the color the vegetation. A solution can be found for most of these problems, but that requires a lot of time
\npar
Keeping in mind that this system is only 12 weeks in development, some promissing results were found.
Most zones are identified and since the ultimate goal is a combination of image processing with a GPS, some false positives are allowed.
\npar
However this system is far from complete, there are still problems that require a solution. For instance when the light intensity is low, tiles aren't recognized. When shadow of the blind person covers the rectangles of a pedestrian crossing, the crossing isn't recognized.
\npar
A more complex approach is needed to solve these problems. To make this system more reliable in different seasons and conditions, more training is needed.
