\section{Segmentation}

Using the features discussed in the previous section it was possible to divide the given route into multiple zones as shown in Figure \ref{zones}.

The table is transformed into a decision tree. Following the tree, left for yes and right for no, each frame can be classified with it corresponding zone, see Figure \ref{zones}.

Later a distinction was added to zone 10. Splitting it in two zones: zone 10, the zebra crossing as discussed in section \ref{zebrasection} and zone 11: the station. However since the zebra detection doesn't work properly, zone 10 is ignored. The division was done since the difference between a zebra crossing at a busy street from a busy station is very important for a blind person.
