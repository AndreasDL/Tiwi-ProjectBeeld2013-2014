\section{SVM}
In machine learning, support vector machines (SVM) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms. They analyze data and recognize patterns used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories indicated by either -1 or +1.
\npar
An SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. The more sure the algorithm is of its classification the more positive/negative the given value will be.
The closer the classification is to zero the more likely it is to get a false postive.
\npar
A SVM performs classification by constructing an N-dimensional hyperplane that optimally separates the data into two categories. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on.
\npar
The recommended SVM, \(SVM^{perf}\)\footnote{\url{http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/svm_light/svm_perf.html}}, was used for this application.
\(SVM^{perf}\) is an implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) formulation for optimizing multivariate performance measures described in [Joachims, 2005].
\npar
As shown in Figures \ref{tree1} and \ref{tree2} several SVM's were used to create a tree structure to classify each frame to a zone.
\npar
The challenge with a SVM is finding the right training data for each feature. The right data is needed to make the Classification as correct as possible thus minimising the chance of a false positive. 

To optimize Accuracy, Precision en Recall:
\npar
TP = True Positive,
TN = True Negative,
FP = False Positive,
FN = False Negative
\npar
$Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)$

$Precision = TP / (TP+FP)$

$Recall = TP / (TP+FN)$

in words

Accuracy = \% correct classified items.

Precision = \% selected items ( cat. +1) that are correct.

Recall = \% correct items that are selected.
